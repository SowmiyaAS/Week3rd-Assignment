1.Selenium:
  *Selenium is an Open source automation testing tool used to test web-based applications.
  * It can support any platforms.It will support chromedriver,IE and Safari. 
 Selenium WebDriver:
    It is the most important tool of the Selenium suite.Because of many limitations 
    with RC,WebDriver was developed.

 2.Selenium communicate with the Web browser:
  Selenium Script create an HTTP request for each selenium command and sends it to the browser driver.
  An HTTP request is then sent to the server using Browser Driver.
  The steps are executed on the HTTP server.
  The execution status is sent to the HTTP server which is then captured by the automation script.

 3.Locators to find the elements:
        *id
        *name
        *className
        *tagName
        *link text
        *partial link text
        *CssSelector 
        *xpath.

 4.ID is prefered than xpath:
    ID is considered as unique key so there cannot be more than 1 elements for same ID where xpath have 
    shows cases when we can get 2 or more elements for same xpath.

 5.Select value in dropDown:
    Import the "Select" package.
    Declare the dropdown elements as an instance of the Select class.
            Eg. Select drpCountry = new Select(path);
    

 6.Absolute xpath: 
    Starting from rootnote.
    Absolute xpath start with single /.we didn't used absolute xpath in our realtime scenarios.
Relative xpath:
    relative  xpath start with double//.
   Does not contain the entire root.

7. How to verify if the given check box is checked or not (it is not taught but you can explore) Try here: http://leafground.com/pages/checkbox.html
               We can use isenabled method to check that  checkbox is enabled or  not ,it 
returns boolean values . 
Returns true if checked and returns false if not. 
       
8. Difference between System.setProperty and WebDriverManager 
        system.set property sets the property to the browers  because browsers does not have inbuild automation 
properties.
      webdrivers execute the commands in the browser.download the driver an dset the 
set the path.

 9.Syntax for preceding xpath:
      younger Cousin xpath/preceding::elder tag.

   Syntax for following xpath:
         Elder Cousin xpath/preceding::younger tag.

 10.To get an attributes value using selenium webDriver:
      To create path and convert to webElement.
      Introduce a method getAttribute and send a argument to the method , arguments as attribute from path 
      and its return type is String.
      print the attribute.
